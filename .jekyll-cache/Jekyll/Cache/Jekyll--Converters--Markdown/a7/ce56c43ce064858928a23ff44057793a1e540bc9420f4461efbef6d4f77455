<p>Now that you have an idea of the steps taking us through this article, Let‚Äôs begin with it.</p>

<h4>Gentle Introduction to Deep learning</h4>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">Deep learning</a> (also known as deep structured learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.</p>

<p>Ok, so that‚Äôs more like a very official definition of deep learning. An easier one you should understand better; Deep learning refers to the various process and methods involving the use of Artificial Neural Networks to build models, functions that learn from real-world data and produce outputs closely related to what they were trained on. Now this is probably a vague definition for it, in the sense that some deep learning models use unsupervised method of mapping functions. I could go around and cite a perfect definition for it, but honestly that is usually rarely important for you and me. If you understand the above definitions, you are very well 60% ahead on what deep learning is all about because anything further than that, is already talking about a specific branch of deep learning like computer vision, natural language processing etc.</p>

<h4>Fields of Deep Learning</h4>
<p>We come now to a place that we can spend lots of time defining concepts and their differences to each other. The fields or branches of deep learning are many and new theories keeps popping every now and then. This is so because, scientists and researchers are constantly trying to improve upon state-of-the-art models and also achieve new milestones. Several years ago, I should think the world was focusing more on how to improve traditional Machine Learning models and eliminate the repetitive ‚Äú<b>Rules and Data In - Answers Out</b>‚Äù for a scalable solution like ‚Äú<b>Data and Answers In - Models Out</b>‚Äù. Now we have Models that are scalable and more confident in unseen situations. I could still remember when I took the course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/">Machine Learning</a> by Andrew Ng, it was everything I was looking for, I was very happy with it, a few months later I took the course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow/">Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning</a> and I could immediately see the huge difference. The difference being using traditional ML methods against Convolutional Neural Networks. Ever since then I‚Äôve been building models with Tensorflow, Keras and high-end libraries for ML &amp; DL in Skicit-learn and python. Why? Because it is so much easier being that models are scalable, eliminates code repetition and is even easier to train.</p>

<p>Not to go out of scope, the field of Deep Learning is diverse and keeps growing, here I would list out a few of the more common ones that I have at one time or other come across. I am not going to be explaining them in detail, this post is more focused on Deep learning and how to get started as a deep learner and the books on deep learning to read that would guide your progress:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Computer Vision: Computer Vision, often abbreviated as CV, is defined as a field of study that seeks to develop techniques to help computers ‚Äúsee‚Äù and understand the content of digital images such as photographs and videos.The problem of computer vision appears simple because it is trivially solved by people, even very young children. Nevertheless, it largely remains an unsolved problem based both on the limited understanding of biological vision and because of the complexity of vision perception in a dynamic and nearly infinitely varying physical world.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Natural Language Processing: It is a discipline that focuses on the interaction between data science and human language, and is scaling to lots of industries. Today NLP is booming thanks to the huge improvements in the access to data and the increase in computational power, which are allowing practitioners to achieve meaningful results in areas like healthcare, media, finance and human resources, among others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generative Adversarial Networks: Generative modeling is an unsupervised learning task in deep learning that involves automatically discovering and learning the regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model can be used to generate or output new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These are just a few of the many different fields-of-study in deep learning, at least the most common ones. The main context of this post is to introduce the best books about deep learning that can guide your progression in this field, it would simplify a lot of concepts and more important, the information would be easy to digest since it is coming from just one source. It is not an unknown truth that it can be really overwhelming when trying to learn a new skill online usually from different sources. I think that choosing and learning in sequence from an equipped book would be a very good way to start.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs it, the best 5 deep learning as of 2020. This list has been compiled based on reviews, price and I have had the chance to read a few of them myself. I hope these provides some assistance in your goal to learn and apply deep learning to real-world problems. Of course, it would take time, the time is relatively comparable to how much time is spent learning, practicing and building models.</p>

<h3>What Next? </h3>

<p>Now you‚Äôve read some books hopefully, in reality you are yet to though. The truth is quite simple , reading is never the same thing as doing or practicing. Sure you are gonna get a lot of guidelines, understanding of deep learning from reading some of the best books around, but if your goal centers around becoming an expert in a field of deep learning, then you need to work with it every other day. I am not 100% qualified to give directions that I can guarantee would be perfect for everyone, because in a way, there is always a unique situation and way of doing things everyone has. The helpful thing for me is that I‚Äôve passed through every single step myself and still doing. What I can say is this, as a beginner trying to have expertise in deep learning, the easiet way to progress is to specialize in one or two fields at first. How you can go about this, is finding that one area that interests you, it doesn‚Äôt have to be a huge interest at first, because interest and passion can grow as you practice deeper with it.</p>

<p>I took me time to discover what I loved best in the many branches of AI &amp; DL. It can be a daunting process, daunting because you more than anything want to learn Deep Learning, but have no idea how to start. It can be very overwhelming if you try to have a go at ‚ÄúAll‚Äù your areas of interest, because In truth, deep learning is fascinating - every part of it.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs the action I hope you can take to guide your progress:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Start by Reading one of the recommended books, this would get you through the basics, concepts, branches of deep learning, some theories and even some practical approaches to deep learning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Try to choose a field you want to start working in, but as much as this is an important step, it can also be helpful to dance around a bit, to find what you love best before making a choice - At the end of the day, regardless of what you choice is, be openminded in all cases. Now I would give an example of why I said so: My Interest in Deep learning is Computer Vision and Image Synthesis e.g Gans, at least that‚Äôs where my major interest lies. I avoided kaggle community because I thought most of the projects there were limited to ‚ÄúData-Science and Machine learning‚Äù. Yh, I was quite ignorant and was strictly into Computer Vision. Short story, I decided to have a shot at kaggle, well, I found out that there were lots of computer vision projects available. And well, as a beginner, I completed some simple Data-science projects, got to learn pandas, scikit-learn and data-visualization libraries. This was great for me because I learnt some new stuffs and actually found out that I loved Visualizing data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, the path to mastering Deep learning(deep learning might be too broad to master, let‚Äôs just say, your specific field) has many channels, one person can do so many stuffs along the way but get there later than someone who thoretically did less. My grammer isn‚Äôt too great here, I‚Äôm also growing in it just like you. What I can do though, is refer you to a great post by Jason Brownlee, in his post he talks about the Best way to Learn &amp; Do Deep Learning - Everything in that post alings with my views. <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-is-deep-learning/">Deep learning Getting Started</a></p>
